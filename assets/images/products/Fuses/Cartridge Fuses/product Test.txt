1. Continuity / Resistance Test (Simple Pass/Fail) Purpose: Quickly check if the fuse is blown.
2. Voltage Drop Test (In-Circuit) Purpose: Check if fuse is carrying current properly without removing from circuit (if safe to do so).
3. Rated Current Pass Test (Functional Load Test) Purpose: Confirm the fuse survives at its rated current and will blow at high overloads doing real protection work.
